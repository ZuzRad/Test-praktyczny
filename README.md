## 📝 General Information
This is a prototype of a turn-based combat game developed in Unity. Players command two armies composed of different types of units, each with unique parameters and characteristics. Additionally, each unit is more effective against specific types of units with certain traits, such as light armor. At the beginning of the game, the turn order is randomly determined, and units take their actions in a predetermined sequence. If a unit engages in melee combat, it must approach the enemy unit before being able to inflict damage. The game ends when one of the teams is eliminated. Two important design patterns were applied in this project: "state", which helps manage the states of units, and "singleton", which ensures that only one instance of a class is created during runtime.
